Fortunately, there are some easy ways to fix this error and enjoy the game. Here are some steps you can try:
 
1. Install the PhysX driver from the game disc. Usually, games that require PhysX will include a driver installer on the disc. You can search for a folder named "PhysX" or "Nvidia" and run the installer as administrator. This should install the latest version of PhysX compatible with the game.
2. Install the PhysX driver from Nvidia's website. If you don't have the game disc or the installer doesn't work, you can download the PhysX driver from Nvidia's website. Go to [this link](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/physx/physx-9-13-1220-driver/) and select your operating system and language. Then click on "Download" and follow the instructions to install the driver.
3. Repair or reinstall the PhysX driver. If you already have the PhysX driver installed but it still doesn't work, you may need to repair or reinstall it. To do this, go to your Nvidia folder under C:\Program Files\Nvidia\DisplayDriver\ and search for the PhysX folder. Run the PhysX installer and when it opens up, it will give you the option to repair or remove[^1^]. Choose repair if you want to fix the existing driver, or remove if you want to uninstall it and install it again.
4. Update your graphics card driver. Sometimes, the PhysX driver may not work if your graphics card driver is outdated or incompatible. To update your graphics card driver, you can use Windows Update or go to your graphics card manufacturer's website and download the latest driver for your model.

After following these steps, you should be able to run Neighbours From Hell 6 without any errors. Have fun playing!
  
If you have followed the steps above and still encounter the PhysX driver error, you may need to contact the game developer or Nvidia for further assistance. You can also check the game's official website or forums for any updates or patches that may fix the issue. Alternatively, you can try to run the game in compatibility mode or as administrator. To do this, right-click on the game's shortcut or executable file and select "Properties". Then go to the "Compatibility" tab and check the boxes for "Run this program in compatibility mode for" and "Run this program as an administrator".
